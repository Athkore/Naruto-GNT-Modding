# Naruto GNT Hacking

Naruto Gekit≈ç Ninja Taisen(GNT)/Clash of Ninja Hacking

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to investigating and modding the Naruto GNT games, also known as Clash of Ninja in the United States. Before you begin, I would highly suggest visiting the [Naruto GNT4 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GNT4/).

Here you'll find a community of both modders and players interested in the game. The Discord channel in particular is good for connecting with people interested in modding the game. Most of the information you'll find on this repository was discovered and written about by the various members of the Discord.

## Basics

For those only interested in modifying textures or installing custom skins for an emulated copy of the GNT games you are in luck. The [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) drastically simplifies this process with the **Dump Textures** and **Load Textures** tools. This will allow you to skip straight to the texture design process.

You can find a guide for loading textures/skins here: [Dolphin Texture Loading](/general/docs/guides/dolphin_texture_loading.md)

You can find a list of community made skins and textures here: [Skins](/gnt4/docs/guides/skins.md)

You can find a set of textures for the game to translate it mostly into English here: [Naruto GNT4 English Patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-NbZB3I4wo)

## Advanced

If you are wanting to do anything other than dumping and loading textures with Dolphin, you will need to put in some more effort. You will want to familiarize yourself with the process of hex editing and the various data formats stored in the game. You can both import and export these files by using the [GCRebuilder](https://www.google.com/search?q=gcrebuilder) with your copy of the game.
