# Naruto GNT4 Hacking
Naruto Gekit≈ç Ninja Taisen! 4 (GNT4) Hacking White Paper

## Introduction
Before you begin, I would highly suggest visiting the Naruto GNT Discord: https://discord.gg/VV6fRsm
Here you'll find a community of both modders and players interested in the game. You can also download the most up to date Naruto GNT4 balance patch. Most of the information you'll find on this repository was discovered and written about by the various members of the Discord, so thanks to them for this :)

## Basics
While this document covers Naruto GNT4, most of the information you'll find here applies to every game in the GNT series (including the games on the Wii). If you are only interested in modifying textures for an emulated copy of GNT4 you are in luck. The [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) drastically simplifies this process with the **Dump Textures** and **Load Textures** tools. This will allow you to skip straight to the texture design process.

You can find a guide for this process here: [Dolphin Texture Loading](/docs/guides/dolphin_texture_loading.md)

There also exists a basic English patch of GNT4, and you can find it here: [Naruto GNT4 English Patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-NbZB3I4wo)

## Advanced
If you are wanting to do anything other than dumping and loading textures with Dolphin, you will need to put in some more effort. You will want to familiarize yourself with the process of hex editing and the various data formats stored in the game. You can both import and export these files by using the [GCRebuilder](https://www.google.com/search?q=gcrebuilder) with your copy of the game.

For details of the various file formats of the game see: [File Formats](/docs/file_formats/formats.md)
