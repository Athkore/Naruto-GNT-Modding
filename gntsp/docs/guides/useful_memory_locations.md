# GNT Special Useful Memory Locations

The following memory locations can be used to modify game values while the game is running. This is useful for writing Gecko codes to change game logic. They can be modified by using Dolphin's built-in debug mode. Please note that these values may be used for other things in the game (many are used while the intro cutscene is playing), so side effects can occur.
