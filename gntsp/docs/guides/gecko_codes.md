# GNT Special Gecko Codes
These are codes that modify the game in various ways. You can add them to games by right clicking on the game in Dolphin and going to properties. Go to Gecko Codes and you can add them here by either going to Edit Config or hitting the Add button (Add button only exists in latest Dolphin versions).
