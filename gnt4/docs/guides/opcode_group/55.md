# Opcode Group 55

## 5580 - get_eye_texture_path

Loads the String "chr/loc/1300" from the SEQ file and modifies it to point to an eye texture for a character, such as "chr/iru/1300.txg".
This opcode is also responsible for selecting Sasuke and Kankuro's alternate eye textures (1301.txg). The result of this opcode is stored
in the first operand.

We can get all costumes to load their own eye textures with the assembly below. Note that r7 is the Costume ID, which can be 0-3 for each costume.

```asm
costume_2:
  cmpwi	r7, 1
  bne costume_3
  cmpwi r5, 40
  beq load_1
  cmpwi r5, 41
  beq load_2
  cmpwi r5, 2
  beq load_2
costume_3:
  cmpwi	r7, 2
  bne costume_4
  b load_2
costume_4:
  cmpwi	r7, 3
  bne load_0
  b load_3
load_0:
  li	r7, 0
  b end
load_1:
  li	r7, 1
  b end
load_2:
  li	r7, 2
  b end
load_3:
  li	r7, 3
  b end
end:

```

We can add this after the existing costume check code by inserting this at instruction 0x800ab634 and appending the existing instruction to the end of the code (`lwz r3, 12(r1)`). Last, we can `nop` the existing instructions that set the eye texture to use. The resulting code is:

```gecko
C20AB634 0000000A
2C070001 40820008
48000024 2C070002
40820008 48000020
2C070003 40820008
4800001C 38E00000
4800001C 38E00001
48000014 38E00002
4800000C 38E00003
48000004 8061000C
60000000 00000000
040ab630 60000000
040ab628 60000000
```

## 5581 - load_eye_texture

Loads the eye texture from the eye texture path in the first operand.
