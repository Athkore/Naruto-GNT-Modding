# Opcode Group 02

Contains logic for SEQ tasks. For example,

The file `m_title.seq` calls `player00.seq` by first initializing it on this line:

```
13BD4 | op_0203 0xC, 0x0 with file name "game/player00"
```

Then calls it with:

```
13C0C | op_0207 gpr2
```

Execution then immediately jumps to the start of `player00.seq`:

```
00010 | b 0x18
```

When `player00.seq` calls the opcode `end`, execution returns to `m_title.seq`.
