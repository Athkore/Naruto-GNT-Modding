# Opcode Group 05

Instructions in this opcode group seem to be related to comparing values. These will set values to the Comparison Register (`cr`). Opcodes in this opcode group are often followed by opcodes from [opcode group 01](01.md), as the comparison happens in opcode group 04 and the branch happens in opcode group 01.

This opcode group is primarily for `byte` values.

## 0402 - b_movc

Move byte (and compare).

Get two bytes from `get_effective_addresses`. Move the second into the first (`first = second`). Store the first value into `cr`.
