# Opcode Group 05

Instructions in this opcode group seem to be related to comparing values. These will set values to the Comparison Register (`cr`). Opcodes in this opcode group are often followed by opcodes from [opcode group 01](01.md), as the comparison happens in opcode group 04 and the branch happens in opcode group 01.

This opcode group is primarily for `byte` values.
