## 2107 - set_hitbox_active

Set the first active frame, and duration of hitboxes in that order

## 2112 - set_timer_decrement

Sets the amount to decrement `sync_timer` per frame. Second operand of `SEQ_RegCMD2` is the amount to decrement.
If the second operand is 0, defaults to 0x100. Also seems to be overridden with other values in some circumstances.

In GNT4, the second operand is always 0 for all characters. Therefore, the timer decrement will always default to 0x100.

## 211E - animation_check_1
