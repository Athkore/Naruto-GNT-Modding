## 2104 - create_hitbox

`21 04 00 26` is hitbox locations on bones. The hitbox will be placed on (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) of the bone, so the very center of it.

`21 04 00 26 00 0D 00 99 00 00 00 00` for example: `0D` is the bone and `99` is the size.

The size is a short from 0x0 to 0xFFFF and is converted to a float. 0x0 is convert to 0.0 and 0xFFFF is converted to 1279.98, therefore we can conclude the short represents a step from 0.0 to 1280.0.

Example:

|Short (hex) |Float   |
|------------|--------|
|0           | 0.0    |
|10          | 0.3125 |
|20          | 0.625  |
|30          | 0.9375 |
|40          | 1.25   |
|50          | 1.5625 |
|60          | 1.875  |
|70          | 2.1875 |
|80          | 2.5    |
|90          | 2.8125 |
|98          | 2.96875|
|99          | 2.98828|
|A0          | 3.125  |
|B0          | 3.4375 |
|C0          | 3.75   |
|D0          | 4.0625 |
|F0          | 4.6875 |
|FF          | 4.98047|
|100         | 5.0    |
|200         | 10.0   |
|400         | 20.0   |
|800         | 40.0   |
|1000        | 80.0   |
|8000        | 640.0  |
|FFFF        | 1279.98|

 
## 2105 - set_pow_dmg_grd

`21 05 00 26` is POW, DMG, GRD.

`21 05 00 26 00 0D 00 14 00 0D 00 00` for example: The first `0D` is POW which is the damage the move does, `14` is the DMG which is stun on a grounded hit. This is combined with the W, M, or S in KF flags.
The second `0D` is GRD which is the guard damage the attack does, but the guard stun is determined by W, M, or S in KF flags and is a flat rate
 
## 2106 - set_ang_dir

`21 06 00 26` is ANG and DIR.

`21 06 00 26 40 00 E0 00` for example: `40 00` is the ANG, which is the float value on the move when hitting an airborne opponent, `E0 00` is the DIR which is the direction the move sends the opponent in

For DIR: Subtract from `10000` to find the opposite
Examples:
`E000` and `2000` are opposites
`CC00` and `3400` are opposites
 
21 07 00 26 is hitbox appearance and disappearance frames:
21 07 00 26 00 0E 00 11
0E is the frame the hitbox first appears and 11 is the frame the hitbox disappears.

## 2107 - set_hitbox_timer

Sets the timer for hitbox appearance.

Example: `21 07 01 26 00 1D 00 1E`. The third byte (`0x01` in this example) is responsible for:

- Set `chr_p->sync_timer_after_hitbox = 0` (start of action) when the third byte is 0
- Set `chr_p->sync_timer_after_hitbox = -1` (neutral) when the third byte is anything else

`0x001D` in the above example is the `chr_p->hitbox_appearance_timer` and `0x001E` is the `chr_p->hitbox_removal_timer`. 

## 211D

Adds some flag to the specified bone id (the third byte of the opcode).

Only seems to be used in each character's 5B, except for Akamaru, Kimimaro, and OTK Naruto. Anko is the only character to also use this in another location, namely her action for action id 0x194.

For example: `211D0C26` adds it to the bone `0x0C`.

## 211E

Removes some flag to the specified bone id (the third byte of the opcode).

Only seems to be used in each character's 5B, except for Akamaru, Kimimaro, and OTK Naruto. Anko is the only character to also use this in another location, namely her action for action id 0x194.

For example: `211D0C26` adds it to the bone `0x0C`.

## 2112 - set_timer_decrement

Sets the amount to decrement `sync_timer` per frame. Second operand of `SEQ_RegCMD2` is the amount to decrement.
If the second operand is 0, defaults to 0x100. Also seems to be overridden with other values in some circumstances.

In GNT4, the second operand is always 0 for all characters. Therefore, the timer decrement will always default to 0x100.
