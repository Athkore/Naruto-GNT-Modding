# Random Observations

This page contains a list of random observations that may be of use for something at some point.

## Menu Debug

Some Eighting titles like [Inuyasha: Feudal Combat](https://tcrf.net/Inuyasha:_Feudal_Combat) have a debug menu usable upon starting the game.
This differs from the known GNT4 debug menu that can be used in battle. GNT4 contains many similar strings as Inuyasha for the game start
debug menu, but does not have references to any of these strings. Therefore it can be assumed that GNT4 had the game start debug menu at one
point but it was commented out. This would explain why the strings are still there.

Since these strings in GNT4 are unused they could be overwritten with data from mods. These strings are contained between 0x801fd91c and
0x801fda28 (268 bytes).
