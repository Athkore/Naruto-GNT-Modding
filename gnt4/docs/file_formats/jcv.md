# JCV Files

JCV stands for Joint Connector Value. These files have a simple purpose.

They are made of 2 parts, the bone table and the mesh table. They serve as an index of what is what, such as how the game knows bone 16 is the arm and so on. Tampering with these files without knowing what you're doing could result in animating the wrong bones or hiding the wrong meshes.

In later eighting games these files are merged into the actual model itself.
